* Proof Objects

** Preface
In Agda doing proofs is a clear process, either it types check or it doesn't and
the feedback loop is really fast.

** Constructivism

In *classical logic* all mathematical statements are either true or false (see
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle][law of excluded middle]]) therefore we can prove that somethig is true by showing
that its negation leads to a contraddiction (see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum][reductio ad absurdum]])

In *intuitionistic logic* requires explicit, step-by-step proofs that builds up
the truth of a proposition, in a sense is "prove by doing".

Under a computational settings using intuitionistic logic is compelling because
constructive arguments correspond to objects we can hold in our hands (memory).

Intuitionistic proofs correspond to algorithms.

** Statements are Types; Programs are Proofs

See [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknxggwRPzU]["Propostition as Types"]]

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Anything you can define precisely and manipulate symbolically can fall under the
purview of mathematics when done right.
#+END_QUOTE

In math *statements* are claims you can make, *theorems* are claims you can
prove.

(NDG: for Sandy "proposition" is too overloaded to be used, therefore he will
use the term "statement")

Therefore theorems are made of two parts: a statement and a proof.

|---------------+------------------------+--------------------------|
| *Mathematics* | *Programming*          | *What*                   |
|---------------+------------------------+--------------------------|
| Statement     | Type of a program      | Description of a problem |
|---------------+------------------------+--------------------------|
| Proof         | Program with that type | Solution of the problem  |
|---------------+------------------------+--------------------------|

This correspondence between math and programming is called "Curry-Howard correspondence".

#+BEGIN_SRC Agda
-- Simplest example

-- Statement: a boolean exists
-- Type: Bool

-- Proof: provide a boolean value
-- Program: true

_ : Bool
_ = true

-- In particular we have two proofs of the existance of booleans: `true` and `false` 🤪
#+END_SRC

We say that a type is /inhabited/ if there exists at least one value of that
type. Therefore every inhabitant of a type is a valid proof of that statement.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
To proove things in Agda we write down the problem, encoding the statement as a
type and then we work hard to construct a value of that type.
#+END_QUOTE

** Hard to Prove or Simply False?

When you are not making progress in building an instance of some type, is it
because you are taking the wrong approach or because it's literally impossible?

Note that it's the outmost importance the "principle of consistency": there
should be no proof of false statements. Otherwise eveything can be proven (see
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_explosion]["ex falso sequitur quodlibet"]]).

#+BEGIN_SRC Agda
-- The inductive type with no constructors.
-- With no constructors there's no way to build an instance of this statement,
-- as it should be

-- Same as `never` in TypeScript
-- Same as `Nothing` in Scala
-- Same as `undefined` in Haskell

data ⊥ : Set where

exfalso : ⊥ \to A
exfalso ()

-- In other terms, if you are able to provide me an inhabitant of ⊥ (which we know
-- it's impossible) then I can give you whatever you want.
#+END_SRC

To avoid chasing wrong leads check first that the statement you are trying to
prove works in the simplest cases (NDG: did I hear "example based tests" 😁)

** The Equality Type

Equality in our case is when "two expressions will eventually evaluate to the
exasct same tree of constructors", which is also known as "propositional
equality".

[[file:src/Chapter3-Proofs.agda::data _≡_ {A : Set} : A → A → Set where][Implementation]]

We can use propositional equality not only to make unit tests but also to
automatically show some [[file:src/Chapter3-Proofs.agda::zero-is-+-identity₁ : ∀ (n : ℕ) → zero + n ≡ n][algebraic identities]].

In proving the identity of zero we got stuck by proving that ~suc (n + zero) ≡
suc n~. We already proved that the statement is true when ~n~ reaches ~zero~, so
thinking like a computer programmer maybe we can use recursion since we have
covered the base case. Problem is that we will get back the wrong proof because
we need the proof for ~suc n~ but from the recursive call we can get back the
proof for ~n~, we need a way to turn a proof for ~n~ in a proof for ~suc n~.

We can do that using "congruence": if ~x~ and ~y~ are equal than so are ~f x~
and ~f y~ for any function ~f~.

#+BEGIN_SRC Agda
cong : {A B : Set} \to {x y : A} \to (f : A \to B) \to x ≡ y \to f x ≡ f y
cong = ?
#+END_SRC

In our case the ~x~ is the proof for ~n~ (remember that a proof is a ~Set~) and
the ~f~ is ~suc~, so ~cong suc~ will be able to turn a proof for ~n~ is a proof
for ~suc n~.

** Identity and Zero Elements

We already proven the identity for addition.

We proceed to prove the existence of zero and identity elements for different
operations.

** Symmetry and Involutivity

We proved that ~1 * a = a~ how hard would be to prove that ~a = 1 * a~? A
reasonable thing to do would be to reuse a very similar proof

#+BEGIN_SRC Agda
*-identityˡ′ : ∀ (x : ℕ) → x ≡ one * x
*-identityˡ′ = *-identityˡ
#+END_SRC

But it doesn't work, because they have different types.

The propositional equality type ~≡~ is nothing special, we defined ourselves, is
not something embedded in the language, therefore if we expect some property of
it then we need to prove ourselves.

When checking if two types can be the same Agda perform the /unification
algorithm/. Trying to unify ~a ≡ b~ with ~c ≡ d~ means to show that ~a~ and ~c~
can be simplified down to the same normal form.

In our case unifying ~1 * a = a~ with ~a = 1 * a~ means trying to prove that
~1 * a~ and ~a~ are syntactically the same (which are not) and worse is exactly
what we are trying to prove.

We can exploit the fact that equality is symmetrical with [[file:src/Chapter3-Proofs.agda::sym : {A : Set} → {x y : A} → x ≡ y → y ≡ x][a proof]].

Then we can use that to [[file:src/Chapter3-Proofs.agda::-identityˡ′ : ∀ (x : ℕ) → x ≡ one * x][prove]] the flipped identity for multiplication.

Is the combinator ~sym~ [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involution_(mathematics)][involutive?]] lets prove it.

** Transitivity

Proofs can be long and complex, as we have ways to combine programs, we have
ways to compose proofs together.

One way is to use the [[file:src/Chapter3-Proofs.agda::trans : {A : Set} {x y z : A} → x ≡ y → y ≡ z → x ≡ z][transitivity]] of equality.

Using transitivity [[file:src/Chapter3-Proofs.agda::a^1≡a+b*0 : (a b : ℕ) → a ^ 1 ≡ a + b * 0][works]] but it's unreadable, but we have a solution for that.

** Mixfix Parsing

When defining operators Agda will let you put underscores (~_~) whenever there
should go a parameter, in a sort of "template" language. This is called "Mixfix
Parsing".

With that you can define different kinds of operators

#+BEGIN_SRC Agda
_! : ℕ → ℕ
_! = ?

∣_ : ℕ → ℕ
∣_ = ?

□ : ℕ
□ = ?

five : ℕ
five = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ □

⌊_⌋ : ℝ → ℕ
⌊_⌋ = ?

if_then_else : {A : Set} \to Bool \to A \to A \to A
if_then_else = ?

case_of_ : {A B : Set} \to A \to (A \to B) \to B
case_of_ = ?
#+END_SRC

** Equational Reasoning

Can we have a DSL to have chain of equalities to look better than with ~trans~?

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(𝑎 + 𝑏) × 𝑐 = 𝑎𝑐 + 𝑏𝑐
            = 𝑎𝑐 + 𝑐𝑏
            = 𝑐𝑏 + 𝑎𝑐

(𝑎 + 𝑏) × 𝑐
  = (distributivity)
𝑎𝑐 + 𝑏𝑐
  = (commutativity of x)
𝑎𝑐 + 𝑐𝑏
  = (commutativity of +)
𝑐𝑏 + 𝑎𝑐
#+END_EXAMPLE

Turns out that we [[file:src/Chapter3-Proofs.agda::a^1≡a+b*0³ : (a b : ℕ) → a ^ 1 ≡ a + b * 0][can]].
